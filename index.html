      <p>Hello! My name is Jennifer Lira and I am Brazilian. I'm 18 years old and I'm getting ready to go on a mission, I'm really excited. I'm a teacher at the Institute of the Book of Mormon in English here in Brazil. I really like studying programming, when I went to high school I went to a school that offers an IT course alongside high school (professional), which made me learn a lot and even do an internship in programming. I'm very good at drawing, I've been drawing since I was 4 years old and I always order realistic drawings. I learned English with englishconnect where my father took me to see the classes, at first I didn't understand it but then I learned a lot to the point where I knew a lot. I don't have a favorite food, but if I had to choose, I would like lasagna.</p>

      <p>Brazil, the largest country in South America, is celebrated for its breathtaking natural landscapes and rich cultural diversity. Home to the vast Amazon Rainforest and over 7,400 kilometers of coastline with iconic beaches like Copacabana, Brazil's geography offers immense beauty. Its vibrant cities, such as Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo, are cultural epicenters renowned for their music, dance, festivals, and diverse cuisine, showcasing a unique blend of indigenous, Portuguese, African, and immigrant influences. </p>
